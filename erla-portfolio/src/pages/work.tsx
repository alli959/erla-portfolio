    This project was about how will my memories from the season 2021 be in 40 years.
Short summary of the project was making a piece based on memories. I started by doing a mind 
map and an analysis of myself as I immediately knew that my project would be personal. The project is 
about changes in myself and self growth. This work is a three-dimensional work in which a great deal of personal intention takes place.
 Tearing the meterial down was a good outlet for my feelings. When I get older and look back, I will always remember these times that I am experiencing today.
  Two years ago I couldn't see anything around me and felt like I would never get out of the situation I was in. I felt like everything was collapsing around me 
  as seen in my obsession with the building which I also associate with my interest in architecture. I decided to also work with wire as I see myself slowly standing up on my own two feet.

    const text2 = `From my perspective Ugly art can be something that is just nonsense, something that doesn't fit or fit into the environment. I think ugly art can also be colors that don't match in a work and something that doesn't make sense to people. I think ugly art can be works that are dirty, scary, unattractive, or something that has no thought or creativity put into it. Beautiful art can be something that immediately catches your attention, something that reminds you of something beautiful around you, like a beautiful environment, beautiful colors or light. For me, beautiful art can be colors that fit together and especially into the environment. Beautiful art can be an idea that comes from a person and the person conveys it in a neat way. Beautiful and ugly art can be very personal in my opinion, maybe I think something is beautiful that you think is ugly or vice versa. Beauty to me can be something I only see in a dream, something that is evident in a soothing, bright way. When I think of beauty, I think of something that illuminates the environment, something that you immediately notice and are puzzled by at first glance. Beauty to me is something I want to have or have close to me, whether it's an object, art, work or person. Something that warms me and makes me feel good and not feel bad when I look at it.`;
